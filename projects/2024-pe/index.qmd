## Project description
This initiative brings the spirit of a hackathon to the world of statistics, consisting of a data challenge aimed at high school students.
The activity is structured into two morning sessions held at UNIMORE’s Marco Biagi Department of Economics. The first session is educational: students will be guided through data analysis using statistical software in a computer lab. Each student will receive a workbook summarizing the key points of the session, which can serve as a guide for future analyses.
Participants, divided into teams and working independently, will then compete in a data challenge. They will use the tools they have learned to answer a scientific question based on a real-world problem. In a second meeting, each team will present their analyses and results. The data challenge concludes with an awards ceremony following the presentation of the projects.
