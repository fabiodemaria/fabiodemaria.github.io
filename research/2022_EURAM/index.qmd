## Abstract

The Covid-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the way business is conducted, posing new
challenges for organizations to achieve sustainable development. The purpose of this study is
to identify the key drivers of financial sustainability in the luxury industry that can guide
recovery strategies in the post-pandemic era. We collected data from the financial statements
of ten major luxury players, for a five-year period (2017-2021). The organizations’ performance
was evaluated using 15 financial indicators retrieved from the literature. Then, we employed a
dimensionality reduction technique, namely Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA), to identify the
four main strategic dimensions capturing the majority of the original variability. Empirical
results suggest that the Covid-19 pandemic has most impacted the operational dimension, and
financial stability may be essential to offset poor economic and operational performances. This
study provides valuable insights for luxury companies to develop recovery strategies in the
post-pandemic era and reconcile financial health and operational efficiency to achieve positive
economic results and contribute to financial sustainability.
