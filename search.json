The purpose of this study is to explore employee-centric CSR initiatives with the aim of identifying the elements stimulating happiness at work (HAW). To accomplish this, we adopt a non-linear and data-driven approach to analyze self-reported data from 441 employees across 21 small and medium-sized enterprises spanning various industries. The analysis brings to light 5 E(lements) of employee-centric CSR: envisioning, related to personal and organizational value orientation; equity, related to definition and distribution of rewards; empowerment, related to career development and professional growth; experimentation, related to innovative tasks and organizational forms; and empathy, related to a supportive workplace and coworkers’ network. These 5 E(lements) serve as stimuli for HAW in different ways: envisioning, empowerment, and experimentation play a major role in promoting employees’ happiness and underscore the importance of initiatives related to shared values, inclusivity, and innovative work practices. Thus, this study sheds light on the influence of employee-centric CSR in promoting HAW and on effective strategies that may contribute to achieving Sustainable Development Goals targets."

The purpose of this work is to empirically investigate the drivers of employees’ long-lasting working relationships when CSR strategies are in place. A sample of 441 employees across 21 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) spanning various industries in Italy is surveyed to collect data on CSR-related experiences. Then, dimensionality reduction techniques and nonlinear models are applied to self-reported data. The empirical analysis reveals the following: (i) at the individual level, intrinsic CSR initiatives are of major importance; (ii) at the organizational level, sudden changes in perceived leadership hit negatively, especially during crises; and (iii) at the intermediate level, promoting happiness at work (HAW) enhances CSR strategies, creating favorable conditions even for dissatisfied workers. Therefore, the investigation enriches the CSR micro-foundation literature by examining the role of multifaceted layers in implementing CSR strategies in SMEs. In turn, this brings important implications for managers dealing with the phenomenon of the “great resignation.”"

This study examines the complex relationship between digitalization and work-related stress, with a particular emphasis on the impact of both digital activities (i.e., number of actions and virtual meetings) and employees’ attitudes (i.e., job satisfaction, person-organization fit, engagement, and work-life interface) on stress levels.\nMethods: Drawing on data from Microsoft 365 activity records and an online survey of employees in an Italian AI firm, this study applies Factor Analysis and Generalized Additive Models to analyze the above-mentioned interactions in a highly digitalized context.\nResults: Findings indicate that the time–space intensification and extension of the working experience has a significant impact in terms of increasing work-related stress when exceeding certain number of off-hours digital actions and virtual meetings. Conversely, job satisfaction, perceptions of work-life enrichment and person-organization fit represent subjective employees’ attitudes that significantly influence and reduce work-related stress in a digitalized working environment.\nDiscussion: This study contributes to the existing academic literature by providing a more nuanced understanding of the dual impact of work digitalization on employees’ well-being.

Leveraging a dataset of over 230,000 tracks extracted via Spotify APIs, the text demonstrates how to transform raw data into strategic insight. Utilizing Microsoft Excel, the educational journey is structured into three key phases: descriptive statistics to summarize audio features (such as tempo and “danceability”), statistical inference to test hypotheses regarding relationships between variables, and linear regression to model the factors driving a song’s popularity. The ultimate goal is to equip young citizens with essential analytical skills, proving that statistics is a powerful and versatile tool for decoding contemporary reality."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nWork datafication refers to the ongoing production, by corporate digital workplaces (such as Microsoft Office365), of time-stamped logs of each and every employee’s activity (like sending emails, opening files, assigning tasks, setting meetings…). As by-products of workers’ behaviors, passively recorded and stored, these meta-data are literally “exhausts” and can be accessed and analyzed to generate data representations of work behaviors and elaborate on them in search for behavioral patterns and statistical inferences about individual, team or organizational performance. This unprecedented availability of data about work behaviors can have a tremendous impact on people management as we know it. However, the reliability of corporate exhaust depends on the percentage of work behaviors that are actually performed inside digital workplaces, and the process by which potentially retrievable information about work behaviors turns into a data representation of an employee that makes that same employee visible to others is not straightforward. As for reliability, now that COVID-19 prompted many organizations to massive remote working, the chances that digital exhausts trace wider portions if not the totality of work behaviors are significantly higher than in the very recent past, allowing for a robust investigation of digital behavioral visibility and its relationships with management. As for work behavioral visibility, we follow Leonardi and Treem (2020) and conceptualize it in critical realist terms [F05] as “sociomaterial performance of behavior”: a data representation of behavior is not the behavior itself and consequently, mechanisms by which organizational behavior becomes actually visible need to be identified and studied. The present aims to do so, by gaining access to one highly digitalized organization’s, we will delve into their digital exhausts, search for data representations of employees’ attitudes (quantitative research methods) and understand their performative character by investigating how aggregate quantification feedbacks on employees’ perception and work behaviors (qualitative research methods). The research will be conducted by an interdisciplinary group of professors active in the fields of organization and HRM, computer science and engineering, and statistics. The group has a consolidated research collaboration on the project topics which started in 2017 thanks to a research grant and which led to a fruitful research agreement with a highly digitalized company that will provide the project reference use case. The expected project impact is twofold: from an industrial point of view, productivity, innovation, knowledge management, occupational well-being can all benefit from the insights concealed inside the exhausts; from a scientific standpoint, understanding how data can be selected and combined into meaningful representations of work behavior is an interdisciplinary challenge that is on the agenda of several public and private companies of our area."

The initial phase of my empirical work involved cleaning survey data as well as metadata extracted from Microsoft 365, which served as a proxy for digital work behavior. Following this, I conducted the empirical analysis using advanced statistical learning techniques, such as Confirmatory Factor Analysis, Generalized Additive Models, and Random Forests, alongside innovative visualization tools such as network plots and heatmaps. These techniques were applied to address research questions in studies that have since been published in international journals. A preliminary version of these results was presented at the 52nd Scientific Meeting of the Italian Statistical Society (Bari, June 2024)."

The first session is educational: students will be guided through data analysis using statistical software in a computer lab. Each student will receive a workbook summarizing the key points of the session, which can serve as a guide for future analyses. Participants, divided into teams and working independently, will then compete in a data challenge. They will use the tools they have learned to answer a scientific question based on a real-world problem. In a second meeting, each team will present their analyses and results. The data challenge concludes with an awards ceremony following the presentation of the projects."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe circular economy is a paradigmatic change for the economic activity and for people’s lifestyles. It responds to a clearly recognized need by civil society to substantially change current practices to ensure continuity and development for the environment and future generations. This research enters the field of the transition to the circular economy and aims to advance our theoretical understanding of the firms’ business model innovation oriented to the circular economy and its drivers, with a particular focus to digitization and managerial practices. The research also has significant implications for firms and policymakers, as it will help highlight which drivers affect the capacity of business models innovation, combining the needs of competitiveness and performance with the growing expectations of sustainability and environmental protection expressed by the civil society. In this view, during 2020 Pandemic environmental problems and climate change became pressure trend that firms must consider as one of the most important objectives to pursue. ESG performance became very important by investors, because data showed that the flow of funds privileged lower environmental and governance risks. So, among the debate about the armonization of ESG standards, there is an open space about how to is developing the passage from traditional Business Model to a new sustainable paradigm more suitable of Circular Economy (Korhonen et al. 2018 and Kirchherr et al., 2017). Inside of that passage, eco-efficiency using environmental variable (Baldarelli, 2017) is considered one of the most important matters to investigate facing future challenges. The research will be conducted by adopting a mixed method which includes a quantitative and then a qualitative study. After having developed the theoretical framework, a rich and articulated database will be built that will allow to connect the economic, financial and environmental performance of firms subject to environmental regulation. The project focuses on Italian companies with the greatest environmental impact. A survey will be employed to investigate relationships between economic and environmental performance, and other parameters related to business model innovation. Subsequent qualitative research, conducted through a multiple case study, will allow to investigate how and why some previously identified drivers affect the innovation capacity of business models oriented towards the circular economy. The results of the quantitative and qualitative research will support the development of a model that will advance our theoretical understanding of the topic and can contribute to the challenges of businesses and civil society in the transition to the circular economy."

I coordinated primary data collection through a strategic collaboration with the National Confederation of Crafts and Small and Medium Enterprises (CNA), administering a specialized survey designed to assess circular practices within micro and small enterprises. Subsequently, I processed the dataset and implemented advanced statistical learning models to rigorously address the research hypotheses. This research culminated in the drafting of a scientific manuscript and was formally presented at the 4th International Conference on Economic Statistics “Statistical models for the economic transition: The new challenge in a developing world” (Bari, February 2026)."

The empirical investigation focuses on the financial performance of major luxury players from 2017 to 2022, starting from the analysis of 20 financial indicators sourced from the literature. Given the multi-layer structure of the data, Hierarchical Multiple Factor Analysis (HMFA) is employed to discern the primary dimensions of financial sustainability over time. Then, mixed-effects model is used to estimate organizations’ stock market performance using the extracted factors, while considering both fixed and random effects. Empirical findings reveal that financial sustainability encompasses four strategic dimensions, with profitability being the main catalyst for enhancing company value and attracting investors’ interests. Finally, this novel approach offers a new and integrated method, including metric and graphical tools, to measure corporate financial sustainability and recognize patterns at every level of the hierarchy."

    "text": "Employee well-being has gained the attention of scholars and practitioners over the past two decades. However, despite the increasing number of theoretical works on the topic, empirical studies are still limited. In this study, we aim to define the well-being construct through an exploratory and data-driven approach, and examine its impact on employee retention. We first used a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique for categorical variables to identify the four main dimensions of work-related well-being. Then, we analyzed these dimensions in a fractional regression framework to predict employee retention. The empirical results suggest that the most significant aspects that discourage employee turnover are related to career growth opportunities, job satisfaction, and interpersonal relationships among coworkers."

    "text": "If there is one thing that the health emergency following the spread of the coronavirus has highlighted worldwide, it is the centrality and importance of data in monitoring events, understanding dynamics, and making decisions. At the same time, the pandemic has accelerated digital transformation and the process of datafication across many spheres of individual and social life for various economic entities. In particular, this datafication process has allowed us to transform aspects of our existence and actions into data. This process consists of collecting, digitizing, and analyzing data to transform it into useful information that, at times, possesses significant economic value. The foundational science for data analysis is statistics. Statistical methodologies that convert data into information are applied to various fields of social life: health, food resources, wealth growth and distribution, violence, rights, war, culture, energy consumption, education, environmental change, and more. To foster a deeper understanding of other aspects of this discipline, this publication brings together contributions from statistics professors at Unimore, who explain processes and methodologies using simple and direct language. The book stems from a Public Engagement initiative promoted by the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia (UNIMORE). It is linked to a previous project which saw the publication of a first volume titled “What is Statistics? A First Introduction to Data Science”. [ISBN: 978-88-89427-03-3]. This second volume aims to illustrate the importance of statistical science in modeling different types of data—from historical and social data to spatial and environmental data, as well as “big data”—and to share the fundamentals of these models even with younger students, particularly those in the years leading up to university."

    "text": "Teaching methods\nTeaching is in-person and delivered in Italian. The teaching method is based on (a) face-to-face lectures with both theoretical and applied content, supported by teaching materials (slides, exercises, etc.) and lecture recordings; (b) exercises and demonstrations of the use of SPSS statistical software for dataset analysis, aimed at developing the ability to apply the knowledge acquired. Supplementary teaching materials (slides, exercises, sample exam papers, etc.) can be found on the course’s MS Teams/Moodle pages. In line with Course of Study decisions, lecture materials and video recordings will be made available mid-course. Streaming, however, is not permitted, in accordance with UNIMORE’s teaching delivery regulations."

    "text": "Expected results\n\nKnowledge and understanding: through classroom lectures and self-study Identification of the steps in the research process, measuring instruments and data collection. Knowledge of sampling techniques. Knowledge of statistical methods useful for measuring the relationship, if any, between two or more variables. Knowledge of the main multivariate statistical methods for dimensionality reduction of a data matrix (Principal Component Analysis and clustering techniques).\nAbility to apply knowledge and understanding: By carrying out homeworks and analysing empirical data, development of skills: Ability to carry out a statistical investigation in all its phases and use this knowledge in real problems in the economic, financial and social fields. Ability to use statistical language to study and formalise such problems. Ability to choose the appropriate methodology according to the problem, identifying the variables and the information to be obtained. Ability to interpret processing results critically and draw conclusions. Ability to communicate results, in the form of reports or graphs.\nAutonomy of judgement: Aptitude for a methodological approach that leads to verify through rigorous statistical and economic theory arguments the statements and methods presented. Ability to self-assess one’s own competences and skills.\nCommunication skills: Ability to address statistical theory in a timely and coherent manner and to argue empirical analysis accurately. At the end of the course the student will present in written form the results and interpretations of empirical analyses obtained also with the aid of digital support.\nLearning ability: Acquisition of statistical and economic knowledge as one’s own assets, which can be used for individual analyses of empirical data."
