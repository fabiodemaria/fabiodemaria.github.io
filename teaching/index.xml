<p>The main goal of this introductory course in statistics is to provide students with a basic knowledge of statistical analysis. This will enable them to successfully fill any gaps related to the subject and approach the subsequent statistics course with the required knowledge. During the five lessons, students will familiarize themselves with elementary statistical methods, from statistical terminology and notation to the analysis and graphical representation of data. Furthermore, lectures will be consistently delivered using an applied approach to encourage students’ active participation and understanding of the concepts explained.</p>
